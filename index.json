Features Application commands Message components HTTP Webhooks Modular Completely asynchronous Built With .NET 10 ASP.NET <!-- GETTING STARTED --> Getting Started To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps. Prerequisites .NET 10 ASP.NET Installation Nuget Color-Chan.Discord is available on NuGet . Color-Chan.Discord Install-Package Color-Chan.Discord OR dotnet add package Color-Chan.Discord The induvidial components are also available on NuGet: Color-Chan.Discord.Rest Color-Chan.Discord.Commands Color-Chan.Discord.Core Color-Chan.Discord.Caching Cloning Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/Color-Chan/Color-Chan.Discord.git Move to the correct folder cd Color-Chan.Discord Build the repo dotnet build <!-- USAGE EXAMPLES --> Usage Create a new ASP.NET project and add the following to Program.cs and Startup.cs. Program.cs You will have to replace Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly() with the assembly where your commands will be located. public static async Task Main(string[] args) { var host = CreateHostBuilder(args).Build(); // Register all the commands in an Assembly. await host.RegisterSlashCommandsAsync(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), config).ConfigureAwait(false); // <----- // Run the WebHost, and start accepting requests. await host.RunAsync().ConfigureAwait(false); } Startup.cs You will need to add your bot token, public key and application id, these can be found at discordapp.com . public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { // Configure Color-Chan.Discord var config = new ColorChanConfigurations { SlashCommandConfigs = slashOptions => { slashOptions.EnableAutoSync = true; // <--- } }; // Replace the arguments with the data of your bot. // Note: It is not recommended to hardcode them in, loading them from an environment variable or from a json file is better. services.AddColorChanDiscord(\"TOKEN\", \"PUBLIC_KEY\", 999999999999999, config); // <--- services.AddControllers(); } public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // This is needed to validate incoming interaction requests. app.UseColorChanDiscord(); // <--- app.UseRouting(); app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => { endpoints.MapControllers(); }); } Commands After this you can start to create your own commands! Here is a simple example on how you can do that. public class PongCommands : SlashCommandModule { /// <summary> /// A simple Ping Pong command. /// </summary> [SlashCommand(\"ping\", \"Ping Pong!\")] public Task<Result<IDiscordInteractionResponse>> PongAsync() { // Return the response to Discord. return FromSuccess(\"Pong!\"); } } For more examples, please refer to the Samples folder URL The interaction end point is located at https://YOUR_DOMAIN.COM/api/v1/discord/interaction . You will need to add this URL to you application . <!-- ROADMAP --> Roadmap See the milestones for a list of proposed features. <!-- CONTRIBUTING --> Contributing Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create.
